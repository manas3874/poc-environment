## POC for metronome player.

Please run `npm i && npm start` for testing the application.

## Working features.
1. Dropdowns to select an octave
1. Color - shape scheme for visual representation of an octave
1. Red colored seeker which demonstrates the playback speed.
1. BPM slider with liveSnap, which increments the BPM by 5 at a time.
1. Play / pause button to play or pause the playback at any time.

## Issues.

1. Play / pause only works initially. After updating the BPM, it glitches. There is an issue with logic somewhere.
